# PhotoBoxy

A simple static HTML photo album generator. 

One template, boring, is included.

It uses ffmpeg to handle videos.

It uses configuration files from JAlbum to read in comments and to ignore files.

I'm planning on adding image detection algorithms to group photos and to produce timelines of people.
